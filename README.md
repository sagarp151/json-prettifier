JSON Prettifier Microservice

Requirements
Before starting the setup, ensure you have the following installed:
Google Cloud SDK (for interacting with Google Cloud services)
Terraform (for provisioning infrastructure)
Docker (for building and pushing Docker images)
Git (for version control)
Python 3.x (required for running the Python microservice)

Instructions to Provision the Deployment
1. Set Up Google Cloud Authentication
Authenticate with your Google Cloud account:
gcloud auth login

Set the project you are working on:
gcloud config set project jsonprettifier

2. Enable Required Google Cloud Services
Enable the necessary services:
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com run.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com

3. Initialize Terraform
Navigate to the terraform folder:
cd terraform

Initialize the Terraform environment:
terraform init

4. Apply Terraform Configuration
Apply the Terraform configuration to provision the necessary infrastructure (such as Cloud Run, IAM roles, and Artifact Registry):
terraform apply
Confirm the prompts to proceed with the creation of resources.

5. Build and Push Docker Image
Build the Docker image for the microservice:
docker build -t gcr.io/jsonprettifier/json-prettifier:latest

Push the Docker image to Google Artifact Registry:
docker push gcr.io/jsonprettifier/json-prettifier:latest

6. Deploy the Service on Cloud Run
Once the Docker image is pushed, the Cloud Run service will be deployed automatically using the Terraform configuration.

Retrieve the service URL by running:
terraform output service_url

7. Test the Service
To test the service, send a POST request to the HTTPS endpoint with JSON data. Example curl request:
curl -X POST https://json-prettifier-dev-cmqq5nwhrq-uc.a.run.app \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key":"value"}'

Rationale for the Approach
Why Cloud Run?
I chose Google Cloud Run for this project because it offers a highly scalable, serverless environment for running containerized applications. Cloud Run automatically scales up or down based on traffic, which is ideal for this JSON prettifier service. It also simplifies deployment by eliminating the need for managing underlying infrastructure. Additionally, Cloud Run offers a pay-per-use pricing model, making it cost-effective for small services like this.

Why Docker?
Using Docker allows the microservice to be containerized, ensuring consistent deployment across different environments. It also makes it easier to update the service by simply pushing a new image to the Artifact Registry.

Terraform for Infrastructure as Code
Terraform is used to manage all infrastructure components, including Cloud Run, IAM roles, Artifact Registry, and networking. This ensures repeatable, version-controlled infrastructure deployments, which is essential for maintaining consistency across different environments (e.g., development, production).

Security Considerations
The service is secured using IAM roles and Service Accounts. Only authorized users or services with the correct IAM roles can invoke the endpoint.

The service is not publicly accessible by default, ensuring that only authenticated users can access it.

Conclusion
This approach provides a scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution to deploying a containerized JSON prettifier microservice on GCP using Terraform for infrastructure management. The use of Cloud Run and Docker ensures that the service is easy to deploy, maintain, and scale.
